# E-commerce Back End Starter Code
## Overview
E-commerce business sites have revolutionized the way we shop and conduct business in the digital age. These online platforms enable entrepreneurs and established businesses to sell products to a diverse global customer base. Thus breaking down geographical barriers to reach a vast audience.
This project was developed using starter code to create a back end application using command line interface (CLI). The back end of this application is functional due to Express.js, Sequelize and a interactive MySQL database. All tests were performed within Insomnia. The site will not be deployed however a demonstration video is provided below.

## User Story

```
## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
